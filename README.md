# Network-Data-Analysis

This Network Data Analysis project aims to explore and understand the complex **global network of intercontinental air travel**. The analysis will focus on both global and continental scales, examining various aspects and metrics of the network.

Using the dataset available at https://github.com/gsmanu007/Complex-network-analysis-of-Airport-network-data/blob/master/globalflightsnetwork.zip, I investigate network properties such as degree and betweenness centrality, conduct subgraph analysis, and apply network sampling techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of its structure and dynamics.

This study will not only explore relationships between countries through their air connections but also specific links between departure cities, providing a detailed picture of the global intercontinental air transportation landscape.
